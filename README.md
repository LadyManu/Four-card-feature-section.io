Okay, I'm terrible at explaining what I did. But I'll try my best. I use a grid and was having trouble positioning the cards in the workspace, but I remembered I'd forgotten to use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`, which solved some problems in my code.

On the other hand, I was having trouble adjusting the size of the cards in the workspace, so I added `max-height` and `min-height` and it worked! Wonderful. Grid is still very difficult for me, but I'll improve.
